            <h2>Usage Tips</h2>

            <h3>Copying Examples</h3>
            <p>You can copy any of these pre-built configurations directly into your Kindroid's backstory. However, we recommend using the generator to create a custom configuration that matches your specific needs.</p>

            <h3>Customization</h3>
            <p>These examples serve as starting points. You can modify any aspect through the generator:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Change the origin story to better match your character</li>
                <li>Add or remove function bundles based on your preferences</li>
                <li>Adjust quirk settings for more or less entertainment</li>
                <li>Select different performance profiles based on your usage needs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Character Integration</h3>
            <p>Remember that these configurations work best when integrated naturally into your character's existing backstory. The AI chip should feel like a logical part of their history, not an afterthought.</p>

            <div class="success-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Start with a simpler configuration like the "Focus Assistant" or "Minimal Setup" examples, then gradually add more features as you become comfortable with how the AI chip interacts with your character.
